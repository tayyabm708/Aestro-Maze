<b>Python based maze game for a semester project</b>
<br>
Aestro Maze is a basic concept of how a maze game is built. It consists of two levels, each having a different maze structure. In this game, the player will have to move across the available path. After finishing the first level, the player will be given a choice whether if he wants to play the next level or he wants to exit. There will be treasures placed inside the maze as well as there will be obstacles. If the player comes in contact with the treasure, he will gain points while if he comes in contact with the obstacle the game will display game over. After that he will be given a choice if he wants to try again or quit.
